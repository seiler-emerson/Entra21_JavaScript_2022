# Introduction

## Console
- An interface where it is possible to record texts, used to communicate occurrences.
- To write something use console.log("Your message")

## Variables
- Variables in javascript are not typed, i.e. the type is fluid and can change depending on the assignment.
- There are 3 ways to declare a variable in javascript:
    - let variable = value (has local scope)
    - var variable = value (has global scope)
    - const variable = value (assigned value is a constant)

## Prompt
- Captures information in a unitary form from the user.
- let variable= prompt("important message");

## Alert
- Similar to the prompt there is the alert that does not capture data but displays urgent information on the screen
- alert("Urgent message");
